        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Recipes collection! These are the main meals I make on a weekly basis, for lunch and dinner.
            Because there is minimal cooking involved, you'll spend no more than 10 minutes prepaping before eating!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am a busy person, and I have been focused on fitness and health for several months, now. So it's important
            that I get quality protein and nutrituous vegetables in every meal. Therefore, the portion sizes will be
            larger than expected!</p>
        <p>So, check out four of the main meals I create and enjoy weekly! The meats I buy from Costco, and the frozen
            vegetables are bought at Target.</p>
