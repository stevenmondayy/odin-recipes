        <h1>Cilantro Chicken and Steak Dinner</h1>
        <img src="./cilantro.jpg" alt="Cilantro Chicken">
        <p>
        <h3>This meal comes from a meal-kit package, that comes with the chicken and sauce, as opposed to the BBQ
            chicken meal, where everything is separate</h3>
        </p>
        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Kevin's Cilantro Lime Chicken Meal</li>
            <li>Two Steak Bites (or chicken, if prefered)</li>
            <li>Frozen Riced Broccoli (or riced cauliflower, if prefered)</li>
            <li><em>Highly suggested</em> spicy salt (such as Slap Yo mama Spicy), as this meal is somewhat bland out of
                the package.</li>
            <li>Optional pico de gallo, for flavor</li>
            <li>Stovetop pan for heating</li>
            <li>Foodsafe bowls for distributing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>And now for the cooking instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab your stovetop pan, and set the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Start heating your frozen vegetables base in the microwave, according to package instructins. (While the
                pan is
                heating)</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes (about when the vegetables are done), drain the packaged chicken (it's completely cooked
                already!) and place
                into the hot, oiled pan.</li>
            <li>Optional seasoning here, then add your steak bites! </li>
            <li>Drop the heat to low so you don't overcook the steak!</li>
            <li>Grab your foodsafe bowls, and evenly split the heated vegetables.</li>
            <li>After 4 minutes on heat, evenly distribute the meat as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal, and now you also have an equal sized meal for later!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I usually make this at night, and have the second meal for lunch at work, the next day.</p>
        <p>I love to have this one with some tortilla chips, if I have any. This meal packs a powerful punch of flavor!
