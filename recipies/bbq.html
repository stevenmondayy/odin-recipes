        <p>This one is my <strong>clutch </strong> meal, due to its simplicity and flavor. It packs plenty of protein
            and hits the spot, every time.
        </p>

        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Two Chicken Bites</li>
            <li>Two Steak Bites</li>
            <li>Cooking oil (I prefer olive oil)</li>
            <li>Optional seasoning blend for meat.</li>
            <li>Frozen Vegetables (your choice, I prefer green beans for this mix)</li>
            <li>BBQ Sauce of your choosing (I prefer G. Hughes sugar free Origianl BBQ)</li>
            <li>Stovetop pan for heating</li>
            <li>Foodsafe bowls for distributing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>And now for the cooking instructions:</h3>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li>Grab your stovetop pan, and set the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Start heating your vegetables in the microwave, according to package instructins. (While the pan is
                heating)</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes (about when the vegetables are done), oil up your pan, and add your chicken and steak.
            </li>
            <li>Heat up the chicken and steak, season to taste if desired.</li>
            <li>Drop the heat to low so you don't overcook the steak bites!</li>
            <li>Grab your foodsafe bowls, and evenly split the heated vegetables.</li>
            <li>After 4 minutes on heat, evenly distribute the meats as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal, and now you also have an equal sized meal for later!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I usually make this at night, and have the second meal for lunch at work, the next day.</p>
        <p>Sometimes if I want or need some additional carbs for fuel, I'll throw this over roated mini potatos,
            instead. Talk about a <em>delicious </em>comfort food!</p>
