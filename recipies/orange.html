        <h3>A newer creation, using a sugar free orange glaze, this one is to die for! </h3>
        </p>
        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Two Chicken Bites</li>
            <li>Two Steak Bites</li>
            <li>Frozen Broccoli</li>
            <li>G Hughes Orange marinade</li>
            <li>Stovetop pan for heating</li>
            <li>Foodsafe bowls for distributing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>And now for the cooking instructions:</h3>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li>Grab your stovetop pan, and set the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Start heating your frozen broccoli in the microwave, according to package instructins. (While the
                pan is
                heating)</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes (about when the vegetables are done), oil up your pan, and add your chicken and steak.
            </li>
            <li>Heat up the chicken and steak, season to taste if desired.</li>
            <li>Drop the heat to low so you don't overcook the steak bites, and pour over 90 grams of the orange
                marinade!</li>
            <li>Grab your foodsafe bowls, and evenly split the heated vegetables.</li>
            <li>After 4 minutes on heat, evenly distribute the meats as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal, and now you also have an equal sized meal for later!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I sometimes trade the Orange marinade for straight Teriyaki marinade, for a different flavor profile. </p>
        <p>This one is a great way to shake up the BBQ Chicken and Steak meal. </p>
