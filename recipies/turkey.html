        <h3>This is one of my <em>absolute favorite </em>comfort meals. It tastes just like Thanksgiving, and you can
            have it any time of year!</h3>
        </p>
        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Sous Vide Turkey Breast (one sous vide package, not both!)</li>
            <li>Frozen Sweet Potatos</li>
            <li>Optional BBQ Sauce of your choosing (I prefer G. Hughes sugar free Origianl BBQ)</li>
            <li>Stovetop pan for heating</li>
            <li>Foodsafe bowls for distributing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>And now for the cooking instructions:</h3>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li>Grab your stovetop pan, and set the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Start heating your frozen sweet potatos in the microwave, according to package instructins. (While the
                pan is
                heating)</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes (about when the vegetables are done), begin pulling apart the turkey breast, and place
                into the hot pan (save the juice from
                the package!).</li>
            <li>Once all the turkey has been added, pour the juice over the turkey, to keep it moist.</li>
            <li>Drop the heat to low so you don't overcook the turkey!</li>
            <li>Grab your foodsafe bowls, and evenly split the heated sweet potatos.</li>
            <li>After 4 minutes on heat, evenly distribute the turkey as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal, and now you also have an equal sized meal for later!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I usually make this at night, and have the second meal for lunch at work, the next day.</p>
        <p>Since this one is a little heavier on the carbs, I make this one the night <strong>before</strong> a cardio
            intensive day, so make sure I'm powered up for some endurance!</p>
